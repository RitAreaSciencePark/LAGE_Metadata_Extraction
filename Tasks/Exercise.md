In the folder Beamstudio_CSVs, you are given a collection of CSV files generated by Illumina BeadStudio software. These files describe microarray genotyping experiments and contain:

- Experimental metadata (project name, investigator, date, etc.)

- Array manifest information (type of experiment)

- Sample-level identifiers (sample IDs, chip barcodes, positions)

Unlike standard CSV files, these files are semi-structured and contain multiple sections marked by headers such as:

[Header]
[Manifests]
[Data]


Your task is to design a script that can automatically parse these files and extract key metadata in a structured form:


Write a Python script that:
- Reads all .csv files from a given directory
- Extracts header-level metadata (e.g. project name, experiment name, date)
- Extracts manifest information
- Counts the number of samples in the data section
- Stores the extracted information in a structured format (JSON file).
- Create a Metadata Summary Table (File name,	Project name,	Experiment name,	Date,	Manifest ID,	Number of samples)
