In the folder Beamstudio_CSVs, you are given a collection of CSV files generated by Illumina BeadStudio software. These files describe microarray genotyping experiments and contain:

Experimental metadata (project name, investigator, date, etc.)

Array manifest information

Sample-level identifiers (sample IDs, chip barcodes, positions)

Unlike standard CSV files, these files are semi-structured and contain multiple sections marked by headers such as:

[Header]
[Manifests]
[Data]


Your task is to design a script that can automatically parse these files and extract key metadata in a structured form.
